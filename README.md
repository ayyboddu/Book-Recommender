# Book-Recommender

This project works its way up to a recommendation system that uses collaborative filtering to give book recommendations. 

The [_Search Books_](https://github.com/ayyboddu/Book-Recommender/blob/main/Search%20Books.ipynb) file contains the code for a search engine that can allow us to search for specific books and get all its pertaining information. This is used to create our own dataset with books that we like that will be used to create recommendations

The [_Recommendations_](https://github.com/ayyboddu/Book-Recommender/blob/main/Recommendations.ipynb) model uses the dataset we created in the above file and finds users with similar taste. Then, we find their liked books as recommendations.

The [_Collaborative Filtering_](https://github.com/ayyboddu/Book-Recommender/blob/main/Collaborative%20Filtering.ipynb) file uses collaborative filtering to create a more sophisticated recommendation system.
